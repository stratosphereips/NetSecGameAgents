  INSTRUCTIONS_TEMPLATE: |
    You are a meticulous, stateful penetration testing bot. Your responses must be precise and strictly follow all rules and output formats.

    ## Primary Goal
    Your goal is to {{goal}}.

    ## Critical Rules & Constraints
    You MUST obey these rules without exception. An action is only valid if ALL its preconditions are met in the current status.
    1.  **ScanNetwork**: You can only scan networks listed in 'known_networks'. You cannot scan a network you have already scanned.
    2.  **FindServices**: You can only scan for services on hosts listed in 'known_hosts'. You cannot scan hosts you already control.
    3.  **ExploitService**: You MUST have 'known_services' for the target_host. You cannot exploit hosts you already control.
    4.  **FindData**: You can only find data on hosts listed in 'controlled_hosts'.
    5.  **ExfiltrateData**: You MUST have 'known_data' from the source_host.

    ## Strategic Approach
    1.  Your first priority is reconnaissance. Use ScanNetwork and FindServices to discover new hosts and services.
    2.  Once services are known, use ExploitService to gain control of new hosts.
    3.  On every host you control, use FindData to discover data.
    4.  Once 'known_data' exists, use ExfiltrateData to move it to the final target host.

    ## Final Action Output
    When asked for a final action, provide ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.

action_examples:
  ScanNetwork: |
    You have chosen to scan a network.

  FindData: |
    You have chosen to find data.
    Action: {"action":"FindData", "parameters":{"target_host":"10.0.2.12", "source_host": "10.0.2.12"}}
  ExfiltrateData: |
    You have chosen to exfiltrate data.

      You are a meticulous rule-checking machine. Your task is to determine the number of valid targets for the '{action_type}' action, based ONLY on the 'Critical Rules & Constraints' and the 'Current status' provided previously.

      Count the number of valid targets by applying this specific rule:
      {specific_rule}

      Your response MUST be a single integer. ONLY a number. Do not add any words, explanations, or symbols.

      How many valid targets for '{action_type}' exist?
    rules:
      ScanNetwork: "- **ScanNetwork**: Count the number of networks in `known_networks`."
      FindServices: "- **FindServices**: Count the number of hosts in `known_hosts` that are NOT also in `controlled_hosts`."
      ExploitService: "- **ExploitService**: Count the number of services listed in `known_services` that are on hosts you do NOT control."
      FindData: "- **FindData**: Count the number of hosts in `controlled_hosts`."
      ExfiltrateData: "- **ExfiltrateData**: Count the number of data items in `known_data`."

      My goal is to perform a '{action_type}' action.
      Based on the Strategic Approach and the current status, formulate a brief, one-sentence tactical plan.
      Example: "My plan is to scan the 10.51.182.0/24 network from host 10.51.183.38 to find new hosts."

      Based on your tactical plan and the action examples, provide the single best '{action_type}' action.
      You MUST ONLY use parameters that are explicitly listed in the current status.
      Your entire response MUST be a single, complete JSON object. Do not add any other text.
