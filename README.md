# NetSecGameAgents
Agents located in this repository should be use in the [Network Security Game](https://github.com/stratosphereips/NetSecGame) environment. They are intented for a navigation and problem solving in the adversarial network-security based environment where they play role of attackers or defenders.

## BaseAgent
All future agents should extend BaseAgent - a minimal implementation of agent capable of interaction with he environment. The base agent also implement logging capabilities for the agent via the `logging` module of python. The logger can be accessed by property `logger`.

For creating an instance of a `BaseAgent`, three parameters have to be used:
1. `host:str` - URL where the game server runs
2. `port: int` - port number where  game server runs
3. `role: str` - Intended role of the agent. Options are `Attacker`, `Defender`, `Human`

When extending the `BaseAgent`, these args should be passed to in the constructor by calling:
```super().__init__(host, port, role)```

There are 4 important methods to be used for interaction with the environment:

1. `register()`: Should be used ONCE in the beginning of the interaction to register the agent in the game. 
    - Uses the class name and `role` specified in the initialization for the registration in the game
    - returns `Observation` which contains the status of the registration and the initial `GameState` if the registration was successful
2. `make_step(Action: action)`: Used for sending a `Action` object to be used as a next step of the agent. Returns `Observation` with new state fo the environment after the action was applied.
3. `request_game_reset()`: Used to RESET the state of the environment to its initial position (e.g. at the end of an episode). Returns `Observation` with state of the environment.
4. `terminate_connection()`: Should be used ONCE at the end of the interaction to properly disconnect the agent from the game server. 

Examples of agents extending the BaseAgent can be found in:
- [RandomAgent](./agents/random/random_agent.py)
- [InteractiveAgent](./agents/interactive_tui/interactive_tui.py)
- [Q-learningAgent](./agents/q_learning/q_agent.py) (Documentation [here](./docs/q-learning.md))

### Agent utils
Utility functions in [agent_utils.py](./agents/agent_utils.py) can be used by any agent to evaluate a `GameState`, generate set of valid `Actions` in a `GameState` etc.
